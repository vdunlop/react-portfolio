      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I have worked in the Software Engineering field for over 10 years in
        both the defense and commercial industries. My specialties were C, C++,
        real-time embedded, object-oriented software. After that, I began
        working in the database development field, working for a startup company
        creating one of the first Electronic Health Records \(EHR\) in
        PowerBuilder. After raising children and taking care of my mom, I am now
        participating in a 6 month, Full Stack Programming bootcamp through the
        University of Minnesota. I am interested in working on backend projects
        that work closely with databases and data analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        For fun, I like to spend time with family, bike, hike and camp, and
        practice yoga.
